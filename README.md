### Which folder do you want to sort ?

-If you want to sort the files current folder(current command line working directory) 
then you can skip this step and go to Organising ways

-If you want to sort a files in other directories,
then copy the address(path) .Then call the function
working_path() which takes two optional parameters

    fileGL.working_path(src=True,dest=False)

        -src :source directory 
        -dest:destination directory

        if you want to sort your files in the same directory then call:
                working_path(True)
                when prompted enter the path you have previously copied
        if you want to sort your files in the different directories then call:
                working_path(True,True)
                Now,it will ask two paths,one for source and one for destination
                when prompted enter the both the path you have previously copied.
